I have a website for a medical company which provides medical travel for customers around the world. WE provide 4-5 star accommodation, plane tickets to the istanbul,desired information about the medical procedure and we help them and support them during operation they want and being sure that they are satisfued. Our target audience is people from usa or uae, since turkish lira is really cheap compared to dolar,usd and dinar people should understand that the cost of their desired treatment is cheaper than their country with everything included also plus chance of seeing the beauty of istanbul.
Im using html,css, js and tailwind for this project.
Currently this website has  different folders( index.html, styles.css, script.js, why-us.html, about-us.html, contact-us.html,hairtransplant.html(information about hairtransplant), plastic-surgery.hmtl, dentistry.html)
