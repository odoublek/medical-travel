              answer:
                "During a thread lift procedure, tiny threads are inserted under the skin through small incisions. These threads have small cones or barbs that anchor into the tissue, allowing the surgeon to gently reposition and lift sagging skin. As the threads are inserted, they stimulate the production of collagen, which further contributes to the tightening and rejuvenation of the skin over time. The threads are gradually absorbed by the body.",
